AcdBrn CMS
===

Welcome to the AcdBrn CMS. This is a project that I started working on back
in 2005. Over the next few years I made many updates to the system while
working for an employer as well as various side projects. The system started
off as my first introduction to PHP and MySQL, and spiraled out of control. It
really was never intended to get as big as it did, and like all short minded
projects, suffered accordingly.

I mostly keep this around for historical purposes. It is almost entirely
procedural code. Don't let the recent dates fool you; this code wasn't written
during 2010 and 2011 (save for some slight updates to make it easier for others
to understand).

If you are looking to learn PHP and don't know much about objects, this might
be a decent starting point. If you are looking to use a decent PHP CMS or
framework, run far away!

The most notable project using this CMS is whitetailworld.com.
